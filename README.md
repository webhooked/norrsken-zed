# Norrsken Theme

Introducing **Norrsken**, an aurora-inspired dark theme with peppermint and tangerine colors. The theme is designed to minimise eye strain and improve syntax highlighting, making it easier for developers to read and write code.

Inspired by [Vesper VSCode theme](https://github.com/raunofreiberg/vesper), [Vesper Zed theme](https://github.com/bdsqqq/vesper-zed) and [Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme).
